"Songs About is the easiest way I know of to compile and listen to a lot of songs with a prominent lyric or phrase in common.

Here are some reasons you might want to use Songs About:

	*	You maybe have some narcissistic tendencies and want to hear your name over and over again in rhymed, musical verse.

	*	You're making your [significant-other,niece,secret-santa-victim] a novelty mixtape.

	*	You're throwing a [cheese,cats,Marxism]-themed party

	*	You are merely curious to hear what songs most prominently feature [cheese,cats,Marxism].

I am Rosie Cima, a journalist, photographer, and singer-songwriter living in San Francisco. I was inspired to build this website because when I was in middle school the only song I knew with my name in it was AC/DC's 'Whole Lotta Rosie' which is a great song but probably exacerbated some pre-teen image issues. I built this website using React, the Spotify and MusixMatch APIs, and my famous can-do attitude.

Shameless plug: if you are looking for the best song about 'Pablo' look no further than my bandcamp page. I also have you covered for songs about songs about cocaine.
